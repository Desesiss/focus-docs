## Focus Model

A model in the focus application extend a [Backbone.model](http://backbonejs.org/#Model). It has sevral additional properties built in order to improve the behaviour inside the application.

## modelName

The `modelName` property is use by the model in order to rebuild metadatas from the generated **metdadatas**.
Indeed there is a generator which takes the `modelization` as input and creates files containing a `JSON`of the metatatas.
