## Previous application model

![Standard application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/KleeGroup/focus/images/ppt/FMK_HTML5/Slide07.png)

## The server side have:

+ All the  business logic (database access, service layer)
+ Routing
+ Security
+ Page rendering (HTML construction, css serving, assets)

## The  browser side have:

+ A fragment of the UI, for interactions
+ That's all ...

## Applcation lifecycle

1. The user request a page
2. The server treat the request, it makes one or sevral database requests
3. The server construct the pages (_html_, _js_ , _css_, _images_, ...)
4. The server return the page to the server inside an http response
5. The user request another page
6. The server perform again the 2,3,4

## A necessary evolution

The application architecture is a model which has to evolve in order to be able to benefit form all new technologies:

+ JavaScript performance improvements
+ HTML5 APIs (Cache, JS, CSS3)

## A simple idea : Single Page Application

The application's paradigm has changed.
As browser gets faster and faster, it was time to move to JavaScript Applications and Web API.

##Schema

![SPA Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/KleeGroup/focus/images/ppt/FMK_HTML5/Slide08.png)

## The server side have:

- All the  business logic (database access, service layer)
- Routing API
- Security

## The  browser side have:

- All the browser routing
- Page rendering
- All UI interactions
- Eventually local databases
- The application logic is deported on the browser

## Application lifecycle

- **First connexion** : the server send  **html** file with **one** or two **JavaScript files**, all **assets** (images, fonts) and  one **CSS**. (The browser add it into its cache).
- Then the application exchange only via a **REST API** using **ajax**.
- An application can also communicate directly with many other webservices such as : Google maps, adress improvement, ...

## Consequences:

- A lighter network traffic
- Faster applications (User interface complexity is delegated to the browser)
- Performance improvement with browser updates (1 time per two weeks for chrome)
- Asynchronous loading
- Server technology agnostic (only http)
