A detail view is quite easy to use.
The question you have to raise are:
- Do I need a load from the server.
- Do I need an edit mode (if yes I need a templateEdit, Do I need a save button
- Is there some special behaviour in my view (events)



Here are the steps of this view:

### Initialization

`Initialize => LoadSvc => ModelUpdate => View.Render`


### Edition / Save

Edit => render =>TemplateEdit => Save => SaveSvc => [Navigate, Stay,  Reload]
