## Motivation

At KLEE, we are building two types of application.
- Communication Applciation, mainly with [Klee interactive](http://www.kleeinteractive.com/). These applications are ** data-centric **
- Business Application [Klee Conseil Int√©gration](http://www.kleegroup.com/fr/conseil-integration.html). These application are ** business ** and **processes centric**

Server side Technologies are multiple: 
- Java
- .NET
- PHP
- ...

The clients are really differents, sometimes with many constraints:
- State / Public applciation
- Business application
- ...

Often, in a business application, page pattern are usable. Using page pattern, application's users are not __lost__ un the application. You can also have a complete industrialization of the pages, and so master the complexity of the business and processes.
