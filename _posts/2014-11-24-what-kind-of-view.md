## What kind of page is it?

When using the framework it is important to know how to choose the good view, and to know how to do that it is important to think before doing:

How is my data?
Is there interactions on my view ?
Should I split it into sevral views?
I have a list to display, should I use a view for each line?
You should ask yourself many questions before starting a new screen.

Here is a first illustration of the thinking process you should perform before starting a new page:

![What Kind Of View]({{ site.url }}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/what_kind_of_view.png)
